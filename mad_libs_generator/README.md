# Mad Libs Generator with Conditional Statements

## Overview

This project is a fun Python challenge designed to reinforce the use of conditional statements, user input, and string manipulation. The task involves creating a Mad Libs generator, a word game where users provide words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) to fill in a story template, resulting in a humorous and unique narrative. Conditional statements add variations to the story based on user input, enhancing creativity and interactivity.

## Objectives

- Prompt users for various word types (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) using `input()`.
- Store user inputs in appropriately named variables.
- Create a story template with placeholders for user-provided words.
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to introduce variations in the story.
- Display the completed Mad Libs story with user inputs.

## File Descriptions

- **mad_libs.py**: 
  - Prompts the user for words (e.g., adjectives, noun, verb) to fill a story template.
  - Uses conditional statements to vary the story based on user input (e.g., changing the tone or details).
  - Outputs a complete story, such as: "On a [adjective] day, I went to the zoo. I saw a funny [adjective] monkey swinging from the trees. Then, I spotted a majestic [adjective] lion lounging in the sun. What a wild and [adjective] experience!".

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Tools**: A code editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE and terminal/command prompt


## Example Interaction

```bash
