# basic_operations.py
# Objective: To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.
# A Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers.

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# perform addition
addition = number1 + number2

# perform subtraction
subtraction = number1 - number2

# perform multiplication
multiplication = number1 * number2

# print the results
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {multiplication}")
