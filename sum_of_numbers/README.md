# Sum of Numbers with For Loop

## Overview

This project is a Python challenge designed to practice using `for` loops to perform iterative calculations. The program calculates the sum of all numbers in a predefined list by iterating over the list with a `for` loop and accumulating the sum in a variable. This task reinforces fundamental concepts of list iteration and variable manipulation in Python.

## Objectives

- Create a list of numbers to process.
- Initialize a variable to store the running sum.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and add each number to the total.
- Print the final sum of all numbers in the list.

## Repository

- **GitHub Repository**: [alx_be_python](https://github.com/BunnyeNyash/alx_be_python.git)
- **Directory**: `sum_of_numbers`

## File Descriptions

- **sum_numbers.py**:
  - Defines a list of numbers (e.g., `numbers = [1, 5, 3, 9]`).
  - Initializes a `total` variable to 0 to store the running sum.
  - Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list, adding each number to `total`.
  - Prints the final sum in a clear format, e.g., "The sum of the numbers is: 18".

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Tools**: A code editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDL and a terminal/command prompt


## Example Interaction

```bash
python3 sum_numbers.py
```

**Output** (for `numbers = [1, 5, 3, 9]`):
```
The sum of the numbers is: 18
```

## Notes

- Refer to Python’s [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for details on lists and `for` loops.
