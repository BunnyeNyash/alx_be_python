# Introduction to Python

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Backend Python curriculum, introducing beginners to Python programming. It covers Python's core concepts, including its basic syntax, variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and user input. The tasks provide hands-on practice to build foundational skills for writing simple Python programs.

## Objectives

- Define what Python is and understand its key characteristics as a high-level programming language.
- Identify various application areas where Python is commonly used.
- Install Python on your system and set up a development environment to start writing Python code.
- Explain the importance of indentation in Python code and how it contributes to code readability.
- Write basic Python code following proper syntax guidelines.

## File Descriptions

- **basic_operations.py**: 
  - Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on two predefined numbers (`number1 = 10`, `number2 = 5`).
  - Outputs results in a human-readable format

        Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
        Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
        Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50

- **simple_interest.py**: 
  - Calculates simple interest using the formula `I = P * R * T` with predefined values (`principal = 1000`, `rate = 0.05`, `time = 3`).
  - Outputs the result

        The simple interest is: 150.0

- **rectangle_area.py**: 
  - Computes the area of a rectangle using predefined values (`length = 10`, `width = 5`) with the formula `Area = length * width`.
  - Outputs the result as

        The area of the rectangle is: 50

- **hours_to_seconds.py**: 
  - Converts a given number of hours (`hours = 2`) into seconds using the formula `seconds = hours * 3600`.
  - Outputs the result as

        2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds.

- **future_age_calculator.py**: 
  - Prompts the user for their current age and calculates their age in 2050 (assuming the current year is 2023).
  - Outputs the result in the format

        In 2050, you will be [age] years old.

- **finance_calculator.py**: 
  - Takes user input for monthly income and expenses, calculates monthly savings, and projects annual savings with a 5% interest rate.
  - Outputs results like
    
        Enter your monthly income: (user input)
        Enter your total monthly expenses: (user input)
        Your monthly savings are $[savings].  
        Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: $[projected_savings].

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Tools**: A Code Editor like VS Code, PyCharm or IDLE
